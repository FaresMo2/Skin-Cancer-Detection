# Skin Cancer Detection ðŸ§¬

**Skin Cancer Detection** is a web application that helps users determine the likelihood of having skin cancer by uploading an image of their skin. The app utilizes AI to analyze the image and provide results, which are displayed in the user's profile.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **React Router DOM**: For seamless navigation and routing within the application.
- **AI**: To analyze the uploaded images (AI is not currently linked to the site; you can integrate it with any available API).

## 3rd Party Libraries:
- **React Router DOM**: For handling client-side routing.
- **Swiper**: For creating responsive sliders and carousels.

## Project Status:
- The front-end is fully developed and functional.
- The AI model for analyzing images is not yet integrated but can be connected to any API for full functionality.

Feel free to explore the front-end and integrate it with your preferred AI solution to bring the app to life.
